<h1>Late Sardar Jodh Singh</h1>
<p>I always experienced a yearning to acknowledge my responsibilities and reciprocate by contributing to the growth and development of our society. Years ago when I visited my son's school, I perceived that the best way to advance society is by fostering education and it was at that moment that the dream and vision of JIS Group Educational Initiatives was conceived.</p>

<p>"Vision looks inward and becomes duty. Vision looks outward and becomes aspiration. Vision looks upward and becomes faith. Now, when this vision of duty, aspiration and faith has become a reality, it is a proud moment for me and my team to see thousands of students pursuing higher education in JIS Group of Colleges and equipping themselves to become industry ready professionals for successful careers. In this process the Group intends to unite all dimensions of Education from Undergraduate to Post Graduate Programmes in Engineering and Technology, Computer Applications, Dental Science,Pharmacy, Hospitality, diverse streams of Management and so on under the same umbrella in order to comprehensively and collectively optimize the reach of Educational Initiatives in every strata and corner of society towards a better future.</p>

<p>Our educational Initiatives believes that creating an academic foundation for social, cultural, scientific, economic and technological development in our Nation can mature into Global Interface by giving way to education exchange in the International territory as well. Therefore, our focus is to achieve unparalleled excellence that will bring development to our society and mankind by optimizing their potential, thereby establishing the observation of the renowned Journalist Sydney J. Harris on the role the purpose of education which is to "turn mirrors into windows.</p>
